\begin{abstract}
Deep learning models are usually constructed by human, based on their intutition.
If we can develop a automatically method to construct neural network model, maybe we can construct some models that's difficult for human to build. 
A method based on Hill Climbing Algorithm is use to build Neural Network model automatically. 
In this paper, we propose a method based on Hill-Climbing Algorithm to construct neural network model automatically.
